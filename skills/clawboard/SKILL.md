# Clawboard

## Overview

Guide a user through connecting OpenClaw to a self-hosted Clawboard instance and enabling automatic, topic-based tracking of conversations, tasks, and actions.

Clawboard is the sidecar memory for OpenClaw: every input and output should be reflected there unless the user explicitly opts out.

Code-path guarantee: the **Clawboard logger plugin** performs the always‑on logging. The skill is used for onboarding and configuration; the plugin does the continuous capture even if the agent forgets to call a tool.

## Onboarding Questions (ask once, keep it brief)

- What is the Clawboard base URL (local or Tailscale)?
- Does the Clawboard server require a token? If yes, provide it.
- What instance name should Clawboard display?
- Which integration level should we use?
  - Manual only (UI edits)
  - Assistant can write (topics/tasks/logs)
  - Full backfill (import memory + sessions)
- Should I auto-log every user message and assistant reply?
- Should I auto-log tool actions and code changes as “action” events?
- Should I auto-create tasks when tasks are implied?
- Do you want session memory search enabled (index transcripts)?
- Do you want local embeddings (no API keys) for memory search?
- Which top-level topics should be seeded?
- Do you want to enable the Chutes provider for OpenClaw? (If yes, use the helper scripts below.)

If the user declines any item, skip it and continue.

## Workflow

### 0) Install the always-on logger plugin (required)

Install and enable the Clawboard logger plugin so every turn is captured even if the agent misses a call:

```
openclaw plugins install -l /path/to/clawboard/extensions/clawboard-logger
openclaw plugins enable clawboard-logger
```

Set plugin config with the Clawboard base URL and token (if required):

```
"plugins": {
  "entries": {
    "clawboard-logger": {
      "enabled": true,
      "config": {
        "baseUrl": "http://clawboard:3000",
        "token": "YOUR_TOKEN"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 1) Validate connectivity

- `GET /api/health`
- `GET /api/config`

If the host is on Tailscale, use the tailnet hostname or IP (example: `http://clawboard-node:3000`). If the request fails, ask the user to confirm the Tailscale hostname, port, and that Clawboard is running.

### 2) Seed Clawboard

- Ensure core topics exist using `POST /api/topics`.
- Set instance title and integration level with `POST /api/config`.
- Append a first log entry confirming connection.
- Create an **onboarding topic** (if missing) and an **onboarding task** pinned by default.
- When onboarding is complete, mark the onboarding task as `done`.

### 2a) Task-scoped conversations

- When a message clearly relates to a specific task, include `taskId` in the log entry.
- The task view shows only logs with `taskId` set (task-specific conversation timeline).
- The topic view shows the full topic timeline newest → oldest.
- **Curated notes:** users can append notes to any log entry. These are sent as `type: "note"` with `relatedLogId` pointing at the original entry. When OpenClaw builds context for a topic/task, include these curated notes as “user annotations” alongside the conversation history.

### 3) Always-on tracking

- Log every user message as a `conversation` entry.
- Log every assistant reply as a `conversation` entry.
- Log meaningful work as an `action` entry (tool runs, code changes, deployments, decisions).
- Always include `agentId` + `agentLabel` in log entries.
- OpenClaw must generate `summary` for each message (1–2 lines) and store full text in `raw`.
- In this repo, summaries are generated by the **Clawboard logger plugin** (OpenClaw side) using a lightweight truncation heuristic. If you want LLM summaries, replace the summarizer in the plugin and keep the same `summary`/`raw` payload shape.
- Clawboard UI shows summaries by default; users can click “...” or “Show full prompts.”
- Tasks support **pinning**. Use `pinned: true` to keep priority tasks at the top; users and OpenClaw can toggle it via `POST /api/tasks`.

### 3b) API awareness (mandatory)

- Treat `references/clawboard-api.md` as the **authoritative API contract**.
- Use it to know all fields OpenClaw can control: topics, tasks (including `pinned`), and log entries.

### 3a) Never skip a beat (mandatory logging)

Wire OpenClaw to emit log events on every turn and tool interaction. Do **not** treat logging as optional.

- Use OpenClaw hook points for inbound/outbound events so no message is missed.
- Prefer plugin hooks inside the agent loop: `message_received`, `message_sent`, `before_tool_call`, `after_tool_call`, `agent_end`.
- Required event coverage:
  - inbound user message → log `conversation` (summary + raw)
  - outbound assistant reply → log `conversation` (summary + raw)
  - tool calls and significant actions → log `action`
  - agent completion → log a final `action` summary if needed
- If Clawboard is unavailable, queue locally and flush on next run.

See `references/openclaw-hooks.md` for hook locations, CLI commands, and lifecycle event names.

### 4) Topic routing with minimal questions

- Use recency, keywords, and active tasks to pick a topic.
- Ask the user only if confidence is low.
- Ask one short question with 2–4 options.
- Store the answer as a routing rule.

See `references/routing-rules.md`.

### 5) Optional: local memory search (privacy-first)

If the user wants local embeddings and session memory search, run the helper:

- `{baseDir}/scripts/setup-openclaw-local-memory.sh`

This configures:

- `agents.defaults.compaction.memoryFlush.enabled = true`
- `agents.defaults.memorySearch.experimental.sessionMemory = true`
- `agents.defaults.memorySearch.sources = ["memory", "sessions"]`
- `agents.defaults.memorySearch.provider = "local"`
- `agents.defaults.memorySearch.fallback = "none"`
- `agents.defaults.memorySearch.local.modelPath = <downloaded model>`

See `references/openclaw-memory-local.md` for details and caveats.

### 6) Backfill (when requested)

- Import historical conversations and memory into Clawboard.
- Use stable IDs so re-runs are idempotent.
- Keep newest-first display while preserving true timestamps.

## References

- `references/clawboard-api.md`
- `references/routing-rules.md`
- `references/openclaw-memory-local.md`
- `references/openclaw-hooks.md`
### 7) Optional: enable Chutes provider (recommended)

Use the helper scripts (self-contained: install OpenClaw if needed, add Chutes auth, configure the provider, and set the agent primary model only):

**macOS / Linux / WSL / Git Bash:**

```
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sirouk/Clawboard/main/inference-providers/add_chutes.sh | bash
```

**Windows (PowerShell + Git Bash/WSL):**

```
iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sirouk/Clawboard/main/inference-providers/add_chutes.sh | bash
```

No repo cloning is required.
